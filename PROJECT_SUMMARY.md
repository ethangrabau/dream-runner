# Dream Runner Project Summary

## Project Vision
A meditative, exploration-based game where players control a cute bean-bag character running through an infinite, minimalist dreamscape. The core concept involves:
- First-person perspective of moving forward through surreal/abstract environments
- Automatic forward movement with enhanced movement mechanics
- Infinite procedural terrain generation
- Focus on creating a cathartic, artistic experience rather than traditional gameplay challenges
- Black and white sketchy aesthetic

## Current Implementation
- Built using Three.js for 3D graphics and animation
- Features:
  - Purple bean-bag character with articulated running legs
  - Infinite terrain generation in all directions
  - Black and white wireframe aesthetic
  - Hold-space-to-fly mechanic
  - Smooth turning system using Up + directional keys
  - Dynamic camera that follows character movement
  - Chunk-based terrain system for performance
  - Score system based on distance traveled
  - No boundaries - complete freedom to explore

## Technical Features
1. Character
   - Segmented leg animation system
   - Automatic forward running
   - Strafing with left/right movement
   - Smooth rotation system
   - Flying/floating mechanics

2. World Generation
   - Infinite procedural terrain
   - Dynamic tree generation and cleanup
   - Chunk-based system for performance
   - Minimalist wireframe aesthetic

3. Performance Optimizations
   - Chunk-based terrain management
   - Dynamic object pooling for trees
   - Efficient terrain updates based on player position

## Next Steps to Explore
1. Visual Development
   - Add more variety to tree shapes
   - Implement dynamic sketchy effects
   - Add optional visual trails while running
   - Consider particle effects for movement

2. Audio Integration
   - Add procedural/generative music
   - Movement-based sound effects
   - Environmental audio

3. Gameplay Enhancement
   - Add collectible items
   - Create special discovery zones
   - Implement achievements
   - Add optional challenges or goals

4. Technical Improvements
   - Further optimize chunk loading
   - Add level of detail system for distant objects
   - Implement save/load system for high scores
   - Add mobile support

## Long-term Vision
Create an endless runner that focuses on exploration and freedom of movement rather than traditional obstacles and challenges. The game should feel like a meditative journey through an ever-changing minimalist dreamscape where each session can be a unique, relaxing experience.

## Implementation Notes
- Using Three.js for 3D rendering
- Chunk-based terrain system for infinite world
- Custom character controller with articulated legs
- Performance-optimized tree generation system
- Camera system with smooth follow and rotation
